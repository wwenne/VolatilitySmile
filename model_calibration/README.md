### Model Calibration


> Based on Lognormal volatility given by Black-Scholes Model to calibrate other stochastic model, to see the relationship between implied volatility smile and other specific models' smile. 
> 
> And by changing parameters of specific models to effect the shape of the implied volatility smile and whether it fits well or not.


#### Calibrate the following model:

- **Bachelier Model**
- **Displaced Diffusion Model**
- **SABR Model**
